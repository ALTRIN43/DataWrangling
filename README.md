# Data Wrangling Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates essential data wrangling techniques used in data cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw data into a structured and usable format. The project covers handling missing values, correcting data formats, standardizing and normalizing data, and creating indicator variables to prepare the data for analysis or machine learning.

## Objectives
After completing this project, you will be able to:

-> Handle missing values in a dataset.
-> Correct and standardize data formats.
-> Normalize data through scaling or centering techniques.
-> Perform binning to categorize continuous data.
-> Create indicator variables (dummy variables) for categorical data.

## Techniques Covered
# Identifying and Handling Missing Values:

Learn how to identify missing values and how to deal with them by either filling, removing, or imputing the missing data.

# Correcting Data Formatting:

Handle inconsistent or incorrect data formats, such as date formats, categorical labels, or numerical values, ensuring data consistency.

# Data Standardization:

Standardize data to ensure that all numerical values are on a similar scale, making them suitable for analysis and machine learning models.

# Data Normalization (Centering/Scaling):

Normalize data to scale it to a range, helping improve model performance and ensuring that each feature has equal importance in machine learning algorithms.

# Binning:

Categorize continuous data into bins or groups to make the data easier to interpret and analyze.
Creating Indicator Variables:

Convert categorical variables into numerical format by creating dummy variables (also known as one-hot encoding), which is essential for machine learning tasks.

# Requirements
-> Python 3.x
-> Pandas
-> NumPy
-> Scikit-learn (for scaling and normalization)
